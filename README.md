In this example, age is given randomly in the range of 18-80 to the agents. 

Happiness consists of two parts:

base happiness, which is random, and the age factor which is also random.

Therefore age distribution and happiness of agents are distributed normally.

When one agent gets a phone call, they tend to buy the products according to their happiness but, again, there is some randomization in their shopping behavior.

If they buy the product after a phone call, meaning that they are glad because of this call, their happiness increases. Otherwise, they are disturbed, and their happiness decreases which is unfortunate for the next call. 
Amounts of decreasing and increasing are not related to age for now, since the age factor is calculated, but still it might be developed for accuracy.

The change in their happiness after sets of calls is shown in the graph. The amount of times they bought the product is readable from the graph by looking at the difference, but I can not prompt it to screen yet. 

In the next update, statistics will be categorized as "the customers that buy the product 4 times / 3 times/ .../ 0 times "

This basic code might give an idea about potential customers.
